## Spotify Clone

<hr>
I've created this project in order to practice TypeScript and learn more about Next.JS, especially the SSR and new middleware functions. It's also another at creating a TailwindCSS interface.</br>

## How to use

<li>Open the REAL Spotify app on your device
<li>Play and immediately pause any song
<li>Log in to the Spotify CLONE with a valid premium account

## The project

The project uses the Spotify API to act as a 'remote' of sorts for the real application.

Among the implemented features, the most prominent are:

<li>Usage of the Spotify API to remotely control the music player
<li>NextAuth.JS used for authentication via the Spotify API
<li>Debounced volume control
<li>Middleware responsible for route protection
<li>SSR to get session context from NextAuth.JS
<li>Custom hooks

## What I've learned

<hr>

<li>I've significantly improved my fluency with TypeScript, including more complicated components, as well as learned more about proper folder structure, typing environment variables etc.
<li>It was my first attempt at using middleware, which in my application was used to protect certain routes, redirect the user and so on.
<li>I've learned how to use NextAuth.JS with JWT and custom providers.
<li>Tackles some TailwindCSS customization, such as creating my own classes, animations etc.
<li>I've also honed my knowledge about creating custom hooks and using the built-in hooks. 
<li>Also improved my project folder structure significantly.

## Questions

While creating the application, many questions arose, some of which I couldn't easily find an answer to. They're more of a "what's the correct approach" rather than "how to do it", but I'd love to do more research on that.

<li>When using CSS Modules, if the same element exists between multiple components, how do I structure that? Using a specific module for 'global elements' comes to mind, yet seems counterintuitive towards the idea of readability.
<li>When creating forms with a lot of inputs, should they be written out one by one, or is creating a config object and mapping them out a better approach? What are the pros and cons?
<li>Custom hook vs. separate file for reusable functions.
<li>How to properly type refs properly when dealing with complex components instead of HTML elements?
<li>If fetching data in SSR, is using an useEffect to immediately set that data to a global state a good practice? My guts tell me it isn't.
<li>If data is set in a global state, is it ever more performant to pass it as props instead of using the global state?
